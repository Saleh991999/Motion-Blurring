# Motion-Blurring
This project simply is a generic program that does Motion blurring for images in different directions and different intensities.
I made this program with three different ways.
## First: Using built_in functions in MATLAB.
## Second: Using source code of the built_in functions. 
## Third: Using conv2 in MATLAB
